This Tutorial will show you how to install Proclipsing and Create a Project with it.  It will walk you through adding the Proclipsing Plugin to Eclipse and creating your first Proclipsing project.

libraries you want, and then creates a project with the desired libs
(with native libraries), and skeleton package structure and PApplet.
