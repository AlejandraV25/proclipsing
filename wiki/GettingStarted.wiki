= Getting Started : Installing Proclipsing & Creating a Project=

= Introduction =

Brian Ballantine and I have developed a Processing Plugin for Eclipse
called "proclipsing."  The purpose of proclipsing is to lower the
difficulty of using Processing in Eclipse.  We'd like to ask for your
assistance for the pre-Alpha testing.


Thank you in advance for taking the time to test for us and we hope
you enjoy Proclipsing,
Brian + Matt


= Details =

Initially, we are focusing on project creation.  To this end, the
plugin allows you to select the location of your processing app, which
libraries you want, and then creates a project with the desired libs
(with native libraries), and skeleton package structure and PApplet.

To add Proclipsing to Eclipse:

  * Place this jar in the "*dropins*" folder of your eclipse project (if your  version of eclipse doesn't have a "dropins" folder, use the "*plugins*" folder)
  * If Eclipse is already open it, close it and reopen it.


To create your first Proclipsing Project:

<img src="http://8.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kr226cVmMe1qzqc80o1_500.png"/>

  * Select File >> "*New Project*"
  * Open the "*Processing*" folder
  * Select "*Processing Project*" and click next

  * Enter a name for your project in the "*Project Name*" field
  * Click the "*Browse*" button next to the "*Processing Path*" field (this is the folder that the Processing app is in on *Windows* or *Linux*.  For Processing 1.0+ on *MacOsX*, this the bundled Processing Application).
  * Select whether you want the project to be an *Application* or an *Applet* (Applet for the web, Application for local).
  * Select the libraries you want to use in this project with in the libraries window.
  * Select *Finish*


To open your first Proclipsing Project and see your Processing Code:

You will see a folder on the left window of your screen with the name of project.  This window is called the "*Package Explorer*."  It will contain list all of your eclipse projects in your current _workspace_ (for more detailed explaination of "workspaces" and packages see advanced documentation: TODO).  Proclipsing has created an Eclipse project for you, with Processing _jar_ files, _Native Libraries_, a _package_ for containing your code, and skeleton _Java Object_ for writing Processing Code in.

  * open the folder with your project name
  * open the folder with name "*src*."  This folder will contain all of the packages for your project.
  * open the the package with a similar name to your project.
  * double click the Java file (in this case "MyProcessingProject.java").

Notice that the file is opened in the center window of Eclipse.  This is called the "Java Editor" window.  Proclipsing
