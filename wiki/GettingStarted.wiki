#Getting Started

= Introduction =

Brian Ballantine and I have developed a Processing Plugin for Eclipse
called "proclipsing."  The purpose of proclipsing is to lower the
difficulty of using Processing in Eclipse.  We'd like to ask for your
assistance for the pre-Alpha testing.


Thank you in advance for taking the time to test for us and we hope
you enjoy Proclipsing,
Brian + Matt


= Details =

Initially, we are focusing on project creation.  To this end, the
plugin allows you to select the location of your processing app, which
libraries you want, and then creates a project with the desired libs
(with native libraries), and skeleton package structure and PApplet.

Add your content here.  Format your content with:
  * Place this jar in the "*dropins*" folder of your eclipse
project (if your  version of eclipse doesn't
have a "dropins" folder", use the "*plugins*" folder)
  * Select "*New Project*"
  * Select the "*Processing*" folder
  * Select "*Processing Project*" and click next

  * Text in *bold* or _italic_
  * Headings, paragraphs, and lists
  * Automatic links to other wiki pages


Simply place the attached jar to the "dropins" folder of your eclipse
project (or "plugins" folder,  if your  version of eclipse doesn't
have a "dropins" folder) and select "New Project."  You should see a
"Processing" folder in your New Project wizard.  After that, the
process should be obvious (but please let us know if it is not).
