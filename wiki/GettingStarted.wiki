= Getting Started : Installing Proclipsing & Creating a Project=

= Introduction =

This Tutorial will show you how to install Proclipsing and Create a Project with it.  It will walk you through adding the Proclipsing Plugin to Eclipse and creating your first Proclipsing project.

= Details =

Initially, we are focusing on project creation.  To this end, the
plugin allows you to select the location of your processing app, which
libraries you want, and then creates a project with the desired libs
(with native libraries), and skeleton package structure and PApplet.

===Download Eclipse:===

Go to <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">The Eclipse Download Page</a>.  Download the "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" for your Operating System.

===Download Processing:===

Go to <a href="http://processing.org/download/">The Processing Download Page</a>.  Download the most recent version of Processing for your Operating System.


===To add Proclipsing to Eclipse:===

These steps might vary slightly based on what version of Eclipse you have.  The wording might be slightly different, but the process is pretty much the same.

  * open the eclipse folder, then open eclipse
  * select a workspace (at the beginning the default should be fine)
  * select help>Install New Software
